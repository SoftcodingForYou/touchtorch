## Description
This is a simple Flutter/Dart-based mobile app: You touch the screen and the light turns on. The light stays on until you lift you finger off the screen!

## Why another flashlight app?
As unbelievable as it might seem, this, to our knowledge, is the first app that enables your device's flashlight as long as your finger is in contact with the screen.
